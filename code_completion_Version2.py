Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion
- Provides:
  1) An "AI-suggested" implementation (simulated) of sorting a list of dicts by a key.
  2) A manual implementation.
  3) A small benchmark and a 200-word analysis printed to stdout.

Note: For demonstration we simulate the AI-suggested code (as if produced by Copilot).
Compare readability and efficiency.

        "The AI-suggested implementation uses Python's built-in sorted() with a lambda to "
        "extract the sort key. This approach is concise, idiomatic, and leverages the "
        "highly-optimized Timsort algorithm underlying Python's sort, giving O(n log n) "
        "time complexity and stability for equal keys. It avoids extra memory overhead beyond "
        "the temporary structures Python uses for sorting. The manual implementation creates "
        "an explicit list of (key, item) pairs, sorts them, and reconstructs the sorted list. "
        "This mirrors the decorate-sort-undecorate (Schwartzian transform) pattern and also "
        "runs in O(n log n), but it uses additional memory to hold the pairs and requires "
        "explicit reconstruction. In benchmark tests both methods perform similarly, with "
        "tiny differences dependent on data size and Python implementation details. For "
        "readability and maintainability, the AI-suggested sorted(...) variant is preferable "
        "because it's shorter and expresses intent directly; it's also what most Python "
        "developers expect. The manual variant can be useful when a custom extraction or "
        "precomputation of keys yields measurable speedups for expensive key functions."
